* Provide:

  A Java client library that may be used to connect to a remote GraniteDS
  server.

* Requirements:

  JDK 5+.

* Examples:

  Download the complete source bundle and import it as an Eclipse project.
  
  The org.granite.examples.CallGraniteDSEjb3 class (in the examples directory)
  will give you a sample usage scenario of this library.
  
  If you want to run it, you must start the graniteds-ejb3 sample application
  and run the CallGraniteDSEjb3class from Eclipse (the classpath is already
  configured).
